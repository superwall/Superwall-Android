/**
 * The interface that handles Superwall's subscription-related logic.
 *
 * By default, the Superwall SDK handles all subscription-related logic. However, if you'd like more
 * control, you can return a `PurchaseController` when configuring the SDK via
 * `Superwall.configure(apiKey, purchaseController, options, completion)`.
 *
 * When implementing this, you also need to set the subscription status using
 * `Superwall.subscriptionStatus`.
 *
 * To learn how to implement the `PurchaseController` in your app
 * and best practices, see [Purchases and Subscription Status](https://docs.superwall.com/docs/advanced-configuration).
