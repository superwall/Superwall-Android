## Entitlements Example

This application flavor serves as an introduction to using Superwall's entitlements.
It demonstrates 3 types of features and paywalls:

1. No subscription, no feature-gate 
2. Feature-gate allowing only Pro users
3. Feature-gate allowing only Diamond users

Entitlement status is controlled either by Superwall automatically during purchase or by your PurchaseController.
To simplify testing, this example allows you to change the Entitlement status by tapping on the `Change Entitlement Status` Dropdown
and choosing the desired status.
