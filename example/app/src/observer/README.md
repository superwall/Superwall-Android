## Observer mode Example

This application flavor serves as an introduction to Superwall's observer mode.
It demonstrates 2 different types of transaction observing:

1. Automatic Observation
2. Manual Observation

Automatic observation can be tested by tapping the first button.
Otherwise, it can be accomplished manually through belonging methods and their associated buttons.


## Setup Note

- Set your Superwall API key in `MainApplication.kt`
- Change `applicationId` in `build.gradle.kts` to match your `applicationId`
- Change product names in `./com/superwall/superapp/HomeActivity.kt` to match your products
- Ensure you are added as a [License Tester](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test) to your app on Google Play Store
