# CHANGELOG

The changelog for `Superwall`. Also see the [releases](https://github.com/superwall/Superwall-Android/releases) on GitHub.

## 1.1.5

### Fixes

- Fixes thread safety crash when multiple threads attempted to initialize the `JavaScriptSandbox`
  internally.

## 1.1.3

### Enhancements

- Tracks an `identity_alias` event whenever identify is called to alias Superwall's anonymous ID with a
developer provided id.
- Adds `setInterfaceStyle(interfaceStyle:)` which can be used to override the system interface style.
- Adds `device.interfaceStyleMode` to the device template, which can be `automatic` or `manual` if 
overriding the interface style.

### Fixes

- Uses `JavascriptSandbox` when available for filter expression evaluation on a background thread 
instead of running code on the main thread in a webview.
- Fixes crash where the loading spinner inside the `PaywallViewController` was being updated outside
  the main thread.

## 1.1.2

### Enhancements

- Updates build.gradle configuration which means we can now upload the SDK to maven central. You no 
longer need to specify our custom repo in your build.gradle to get our SDK and therefore installation 
should be easier.

### Fixes

- Fixes `ConcurrentModificationException` crash that sometimes happened when identifying a user.
- Fixes crash on purchasing a free trial when using `getPaywall`.

## 1.1.1

### Fixes

- Fixes an issue loading products with offers.

## 1.1.0

### Enhancements

- SW-2768: Adds `device.regionCode` and `device.preferredRegionCode`, which returns the `regionCode` 
of the locale. For example, if a locale is `en_GB`, the `regionCode` will be `GB`. You can use this
in the filters of your campaign.
- Adds support for unlimited products in a paywall.
- SW-2785: Adds internal feature flag to disable verbose events like `paywallResponseLoad_start`.

### Fixes

- SW-2732: User attributes weren't being sent on app open until identify was called. Now they are 
sent every time there's a new session.
- SW-2733: Fixes issue where the spinner would still show on a paywall if a user had previously
  purchased on it.
- SW-2744: Fixes issue where using the back button to dismiss a paywall presented via `getPaywall`
would call `didFinish` in the `PaywallViewControllerDelegate` with the incorrect values.
- Fixes issue where an invalid paywall background color would prevent the paywall from opening. If 
this happens, it will now default to white.
- SW-2748: Exposes `viewWillAppear`, `viewDidAppear`, `viewWillDisappear` and `viewDidDisappear` 
methods of `PaywallViewController` which you must call when using `getPaywall`.
- Stops `Superwall.configure` from being called multiple times.
- `getPresentationResult` now confirms assignments for holdouts.
- Gracefully handles unknown local notification types if new ones are added in the future.
- SW-2761: Fixes issue where "other" responses in paywall surveys weren't showing in the dashboard.

## 1.0.2

### Fixes

- Prevents a paywall from opening in a separate activity inside a task manager when using `taskAffinity` 
within your app.

## 1.0.1

### Fixes

- Fixes serialization of `feature_gating` in `SuperwallEvents`.
- Changes the product loading so that if preloading is enabled, it makes one API request to get all 
products available in paywalls. This results in fewer API requests. Also, it adds retry logic on failure. 
If billing isn't available on device, the `onError` handler will be called.

## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Changes the import path for the `LogScope`, and `LogLevel`.

### Fixes

- Fixes rare thread-safety crash when sending events back to Superwall's servers.
- Calls the `onError` presentation handler block when there's no activity to present a paywall on.
- Fixes issue where the wrong product may be presented to purchase if a free trial had already been 
used and you were letting Superwall handle purchases.
- Fixes `IllegalStateException` on Samsung devices when letting Superwall handle purchases.
- Keeps the text zoom of paywalls to 100% rather than respecting the accessibility settings text zoom,
which caused unexpected UI issues.
- Fixes rare `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` crash caused by a threading issue.
- Fixes crash when the user has disabled the Android System WebView.

## 1.0.0-alpha.45

### Fixes

- Fixes issue where the `paywallProductsLoad_fail` event wasn't correctly being logged. This is a
"soft fail", meaning that even though it gets logged, your paywall will still show. The error message
with the event has been updated to include all product subscription IDs that are failing to be retrieved.

## 1.0.0-alpha.44

### Fixes

- Fixes rare issue where paywall preloading was preventing paywalls from showing.

the most recently presented view controller.
- SW-2683: Adds `Superwall.instance.isLoggedIn`, which you can use to check if the user is logged in.

### Fixes

- Removes use of `USE_EXACT_ALARM` permission that was getting apps rejected.
- Fixes issue with scheduling notifications. The paywall wasn't waiting to schedule notifications
  before dismissal so the permissions wasn't always showing.

### Fixes

- Fixes bug where paywalls might not present on first app install.

purchased.

logs from being printed to the console.

### Enhancements

- SW-2663: Adds `preloadAllPaywalls()` and `preloadPaywalls(eventNames:)` to be able to manually 
preload paywalls.
- SW-2665: Adds `Superwall.instance.userId` so you can access the current user's id.
- SW-2668: Adds `preferredLocale` and `preferredLanguageLocale` to the device attributes for use in rules.

the paywall with or without a trial.
